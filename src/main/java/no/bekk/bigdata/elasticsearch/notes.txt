*** ENSURING CORRECT JVM-VERSION (Debian-based) ***

Add repos to apt-get, by adding lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main

Run as root:
apt-get update
apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

Add to ~/.bashrc to make sure we use Oracle's JVM:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
