Different java versions on server/client cause serialization issues for Elastic search Java API.

What to look at in elastic search config files:
cluster name: all nodes with the same cluster name on the same network will join the same cluster.
master: id this server is allowed to be a master. Masters receive requests and coordinate the cluster.
data: whether this server will store data, or just pull data from other node to do load-balancing.
Need to look up a good config of these for a larger cluster.
