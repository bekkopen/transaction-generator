*** ENSURING CORRECT JVM-VERSION (Debian-based) ***
Add repos to apt-get, by adding lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main

Run as root:
apt-get update
apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

Add to ~/.bashrc to make sure we use Oracle's JVM:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle

*** MISC ***
Once an index has been created, it's number of shards cannot be changed (Without re-indexing the data).




Different java versions on server/client cause serialization issues for Elastic search Java API.

What to look at in elastic search config files:
cluster name: all nodes with the same cluster name on the same network will join the same cluster.
master: id this server is allowed to be a master. Masters receive requests and coordinate the cluster.
data: whether this server will store data, or just pull data from other node to do load-balancing.
Need to look up a good config of these for a larger cluster.
